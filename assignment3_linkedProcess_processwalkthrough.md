As seen in the above screenshots, service to get inventory items, browse inventory items activity, and request selected item activity are all part of separate process.

This process is linked to clerk activity and customer activity as both the users perform same set of activities defined in this linked process (i.e, view all the inventory items, select an item from the list and submit the request).
