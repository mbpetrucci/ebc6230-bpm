The wiki project is the university Course material for Business Process Management (EBC 6230).
The course introduces business process modelling concepts by offering hands on experience to the students on the business process tool- IBM’ Business Process Manager (version 8.5.5).

It is expected that by the end of this course, the students have thoroughly understood the concepts of business process management and are capable of modelling business processes.
