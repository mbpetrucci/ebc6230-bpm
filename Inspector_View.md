# Debugging with Inspector #

  * Inspector allows the process developer to run instance of the process on the Process Center Server.
  * By using the Inspector, one can demonstrate playbacks of the solution in real-time.

The following images show the Inspector interface and each major functional area:

  * As seen in the screen shot, click on the 'run' button which is seen at the extreme  right corner.
  * This will take you to the Inspector View.

  * Select the created process instance. You will see the tasks on the right side of the Inspector window.
  * Select the current task and click on 'run' button to open the user-interface in the browser.

  * In the top left we have the list of process instances.

  * These can be filtered by instance name or by process status.

  * The instance name is a dynamic filter and can be extremely useful if there are many entries in the list.

  * Entering a prefix or part of the name can dramatically reduce the number of items to be seen.
