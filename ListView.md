## List View ##

You can use the variables to create input or output texts on a coach. These can also be dragged as a set of variables and also used as a table which consists the list of all the variables shown as a listview.

Consider the below case:

We see that the variables section on the right side has four listed variables naming softwareName, projectName, softwareUsedFor, employeeNumber. In order to view these variables and their respective data on the coach view, we have to drag the variable on the coach into any section and you would see the above list view.

Also, considering when we click on each variable item on the list view, we see in the properties below in the binding section the variable shown here is same as the ones in the variables section of the coach elements.

Note: The binding can be done even by selecting the related variable from the binding selection under the behavior of the input or output text fields.
