## Restoring the archived projects ##
  * The user can restore the archived process from the process Apps screen too. He first needs to click on 'Archived' option from the Process Apps screen, which would list the archived processes.
  * He should then select the process that he wants to restore and click on 'Restore' option. By doing this, the process is no more archived and is now seen in the process listing.
