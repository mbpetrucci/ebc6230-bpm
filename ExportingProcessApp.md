# Exporting Process Application #

Export offers a way to keep a backup of the project. By exporting the process app, one will be saving a copy of the process app on one's local drive. Exporting a process app actually means exporting a snapshot of the selected process app.

## Steps to export Process app ##
  * From the Process App tab, select the process application, that you want to export. This will take you to the window where all the snapshots of that selected process app are displayed.

  * Choose a snapshot that you want to export and click on 'Export' seen next to the name of that snapshot.
This will pop a 'Export Process App' dialog window showing three option:
    * IBM BPM Export in .twx format
    * BPMN 2.0 Export in .zip
    * SAP Solution Manager

### Note ###
You may choose to export the snapshot as .twx or .zip file.

The file will begin to export and you may choose a location on your drive to save the exported file.

The following screenshot explains how an export of snapshot can be done.
