## Snapshot ##
Snapshot captures the state of elements within business process app at a specific point in time.

Snapshots are read only.

To export a process app, a snapshot of that app needs to be created first.

### How to take snapshots ###
The followings steps explain how a snapshot of the business process application can be taken from process designer.

#### Note ####
Snapshots serve as data back up.

You can always revert to previous snapshots.

Snapshots cannot be changed, as they are read-only.

  * One can view all the snapshots of a selected process app/project under 'Revision History'.

In Revision History, one can view the history(what changes are made by whom during the course action) and also previous snapshots.

  * To create a new snapshot, click on 'Snapshot' seen on the top right corner of the process app/project (as shown in the screenshot)
This will open 'Take Snapshot' popup window asking for new snapshot name and description of the new snapshot.

#### Note ####
  * Always name snapshot in this format:  <v0.1>
  * Though Description is not mandatory, it is a good practice to provide description. Please provide what that snapshot signifies as the description of that snapshot

  * Once the snapshot is created, you should see the same under 'Revision History'.
