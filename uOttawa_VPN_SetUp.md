# uOttawa VPN Setup #

  * **If you already have uOttawa VPN installed or you are working on a lab computer, you may skip this tutorial**

> _IMPORTANT NOTE: The following links are accessible only if you are connected to the University network, i.e. from a lab computer or from your personal laptop using the uOttawa VPN. If you are working on your laptop, and do not have the VPN client set up already, then you will need to download the appropriate client below from a lab computer and copy the setup file to your laptop using a CD or a USB flash drive. The files are also small enough to e-mail it to yourself as an attachment. Alternatively, you may get the VPN client from the uOttawa Support Site  [here](http://www.uottawa.ca/support)_

If you have other (non-Cisco) VPN or Hotspot shield software (like Connectify, HotSpot Shield etc), the uOttawa Cisco VPN might not work. There is no single solution, success may vary.
